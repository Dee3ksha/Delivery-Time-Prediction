# Delivery-Time-Prediction
Food delivery time prediction using R

-Created a Machine learning model to predict delivery time in minutes.

-correlation and anova test to see which columns are good to build this model.

-scatter plot, histogram plot, barplot to plot the relation between the predictors and target variables.

-used decision tree and polynomial regression model to check my prediction.

-dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravmalik26/food-delivery-dataset?select=train.csv)
